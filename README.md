Instructions:

1. Open Terminal.
2. Navigate to the SalesTaxProgram file within the Terminal.
3. Type "javac SalesTaxProgram.java" and press enter.
4. Type "java SalesTaxProgram" and press enter.

Note: To run Baskets Two and Three, you will have to manually change the string in the SalesTaxProgram.java file to "baskets/BasketTwo" and "baskets/BasketThree".

Tests: Tests are located in the "tests" folder. I recommend copying the files over to Spring and running the tests there.

Assumptions:

- I assumed that MVP would be preferred.
- I assumed that it was unnecessary to include a prompt and accept user input to direct the program to the basket.txt files.
- I assumed that double would be an acceptable data type for currency. I contemplated using BigDecimal, but went for simplicity.
